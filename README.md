# Maze Project- Part A
In this project we built a maze game.
The maze uses 3 creation algorithms and 3 search algorithms in order to solve it (BFS,DFS,Best First Search).

By using client-server architecture we allowed multiple clients to operate in parallel (using threads), send requests and receive responses from the servers that create mazes and solve mazes, by sending compressed mazes.
